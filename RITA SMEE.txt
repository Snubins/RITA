What is RITA/What is RITA used for:Real Intelligence Threat Analytics (RITA) is an open-source framework for detecting command and control communication through network packet/traffic analysis. The RITA framework could easily ingests Zeek raw logs or could also offline convert network capture files(PCAPs) to Zeek logs for further metadata based analysis.

Network packet capture are normally the first step hunt teaming in any environment. And zeek along-with RITA easy life of threat Hunters by automating some of the tasks of metadata extraction from zeek and importing it to RITA for automated analysis. RITAmay require some basic .yaml file changes to fine tune the analysis.
